    <p>


Hi! My name is Sareeye, and I'm a beginner in web development with a big dream — to become a full-stack developer. I recently started learning HTML and I'm excited to explore the world of coding, one step at a time.
I enjoy building simple web pages and experimenting with design and layout. Every day, I learn something new and get closer to understanding how websites work from front to back.
My goal is to master both frontend and backend technologies so I can create complete web applications that solve real problems. I'm passionate, curious, and committed to growing in this field.
If you're also learning or working in tech, I'd love to connect and share ideas!
